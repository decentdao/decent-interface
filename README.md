# Decent Interface

## Local Development

Clone the repository

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:decentdao/decent-interface.git
```

Change to application's `Node.js` version

```shell
$ nvm use
```

Install the dependencies

```shell
$ npm install
```

Running development environment

```shell
$ npm run dev
```

### Netlify functions

We're using `Netlify` functions for retrieving various off-chain data. You can run these using `npm run dev:netlify`.
Currently it's being used to fetch abstract `address`'s ERC-20, ERC-721 and DeFi balances through `Moralis`.
It is crucial to have `Netlify` functions running locally to work with anything related to DAO treasury, for instance

- Treasury page
- Payments feature

### Cloudflare Pages functions

We're using Cloudflare Pages functions for retrieving various off-chain data.
Currently it's being used to fetch abstract `address`'s ERC-20, ERC-721 and DeFi balances through `Moralis`.
It is crucial to have Cloudflare Pages functions running locally to work with anything related to DAO treasury, for instance

- Treasury page
- Payments feature

### Environment Variables

The application uses two sets of environment variables:

1. **Functions Environment Variables** (`.dev.vars`)

   - Copy `.dev.vars.example` to `.dev.vars` for local development
   - Contains variables needed for Cloudflare Pages Functions (e.g., Moralis API key)
   - In production, these need to be manually configured as "secrets" in the Cloudflare Dashboard

2. **Application Environment Variables** (`.env.local`)
   - Copy `.env` to `.env.local` for local development
   - Contains Vite-injected variables for the React application
   - In production, these also need to be manually configured as "secrets" in the Cloudflare Dashboard

## Feature flags

### Setup

Start with adding a new Feature Flag to the app. In https://github.com/decentdao/decent-interface/src/helpers/featureFlags.ts, Add a flag.

```typescript
export const FEATURE_FLAGS = [
  'flag_dev',
  'flag_demo',
  'flag_yelling', // <-- new flag
] as const;
```

### Usage

In consumer of the flag, use the convenience function

```typescript
import { isFeatureEnabled } from '@/helpers/featureFlags';

if (isFeatureEnabled('flag_yelling')) {
  // code here
}
```

### Injecting flags via your environment

During development, add a flag environment variable in your (local) .env(.local) file. It must be a string value of "ON" or "OFF". The syntax of the environment variable is `VITE_APP_<FLAG_NAME>`.

```shell
VITE_APP_FLAG_YELLING="ON"
```

You can also set the flag in the URL with a query param. Notice how the `VITE_APP_` prefix is omitted and the flag name in the query param matches the name you gave it in code:

```shell
http://localhost:3000/?flag_yelling=on
```

### Testing

Override the flag value by adding query params to the URL. Notice how the `VITE_APP_` prefix is omitted and the flag name is in lowercase:

```
https://app.dev.decentdao.org?flag_yelling=on
```

From then, the flag holds the value from the URL param until app is refreshed

### Deployment and after

Deployment can ship with the flag turned off in .env file.

Change the value in .env file after the feature is completed and thouroughly tested.

Once code under the feature flag has been proven reliable, remove the feature flag and dead code from code base.

## Subgraph

We're using `Subgraph` to index certain "metadata" events to simplify data fetching from application site.
Repository, that implements mapping located [here](https://github.com/decentdao/decent-subgraph).

If you updated mapping and deployed new version - you might need to rebuild `Subgraph` artifacts. Use command below.

Build Subgraph artifacts

```shell
$ npm run graphql:build
```

## Deployment Notes

This app is deployed on Cloudflare Pages with the following configuration:

- Production deployment (tracking `main` branch): https://app.new.decentdao.org
- All other branches get preview deployments at: https://branch-name.decent-interface.pages.dev
